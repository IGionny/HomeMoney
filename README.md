HomeMoney
=========

*** STILL IN ALPHA ***

HomeMoney is an Asp.Net Core WebApp with a Front-End written in VueJs (Vuetify) and Typescript to manage the moneys of a simple
family.
Freely inspired by MoneyTracker project https://demo.moneytracker.cc

The idea is to have a web app (mobile/wife friendly) to install into a Raspberry3+ @ home.\
The data will be persisted in a postgresql database or in a SqlLite.\
Every hours a backup system will sync data with a file in a customizable G-Drive space.
